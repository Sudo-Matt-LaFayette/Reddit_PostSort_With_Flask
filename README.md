## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Reddit API

1. Go to [Reddit App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
2. Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
3. Choose "script" as the app type
4. Note down your `client_id` and `client_secret`

### 3. Set Environment Variables

1. Copy `env_example.txt` to `.env` (Windows PowerShell command):
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item "env_example.txt" ".env"
   ```
   Or in Windows Command Prompt:
   ```cmd
   copy env_example.txt .env
   ```
2. Edit the `.env` file and fill in your Reddit API credentials:

SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here-change-this-in-production
```

**Important**: 
- Replace `YourUsername` in `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` with your actual Reddit username
- Use a strong, random `SECRET_KEY` for production

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### First Time Setup

1. **Configure Reddit API**: Make sure your `.env` file is properly configured
2. **Fetch Posts**: Click "Fetch Saved Posts" to retrieve your saved Reddit posts
3. **Create Categories**: Go to Categories page and create custom categories

## Database Schema

- `name`: Category name (unique)
- `color`: Hex color code for the category
- `created_at`: Timestamp when category was created

### Reddit Posts
- `id`: Primary key
- `reddit_id`: Reddit post ID (unique)
- `title`: Post title
- `author`: Post author
- `subreddit`: Subreddit name
- `url`: Post URL
- `selftext`: Self-post text content
- `score`: Post score (upvotes - downvotes)
- `num_comments`: Number of comments
- `created_utc`: When the post was created on Reddit
- `saved_at`: When the post was saved locally
- `category_id`: Foreign key to categories table
- `permalink`: Reddit permalink
- `is_self`: Whether it's a self-post
- `thumbnail`: Thumbnail URL
- `preview_url`: Preview image URL

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Home page with recent posts
- `GET /fetch_saved_posts`: Fetch new saved posts from Reddit
- `GET /posts`: View all posts with filtering
- `GET /categories`: Manage categories
- `POST /create_category`: Create a new category

- `GET /delete_category/<id>`: Delete a category
- `POST /assign_category/<post_id>`: Assign a post to a category
- `GET /api/posts`: JSON API for posts

## Security Notes

- Store your `.env` file securely and never commit it to version control
- Use a strong `SECRET_KEY` for production deployments
- Your Reddit credentials are only used for API access and stored locally

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Error fetching saved posts"**
   - Check your Reddit API credentials in `.env`
   - Ensure your Reddit account has saved posts
   - Verify your Reddit app is configured as a "script" type

2. **Database errors**
   - Delete `reddit_sorter.db` to reset the database
   - Restart the application

3. **Permission errors**
   - Ensure the application has write permissions in the project directory
   - Check that SQLite can create the database file

### Getting Reddit API Credentials

1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: Any name (e.g., "My Reddit Sorter")
   - **App type**: Select "script"
   - **Description**: Optional
   - **About URL**: Optional
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:8080` (required but not used)

## QA Testing & Bug Fixes

During quality assurance testing, the following issues were identified and resolved:

### Issue #1: Missing `.env` Configuration File
**Found By:** QA Testing  
**Description:** Application failed to start with error "Required configuration setting 'client_id' missing"  
**Root Cause:** The `.env` file was not created from the example template, and setup instructions were unclear about the Windows command needed  
**Resolution:**
- Created proper `.env` file with correct formatting (removed extra spaces after `=` signs)
- Updated `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` to include actual username
- Enhanced README.md Section 3 to include explicit Windows terminal commands:
  - PowerShell: `Copy-Item "env_example.txt" ".env"`
  - Command Prompt: `copy env_example.txt .env`

### Issue #2: Category Dropdown Menu Appearing Behind Post Cards
**Found By:** QA Testing  
**Description:** When clicking the category dropdown on a post card, the menu appeared behind adjacent post cards instead of on top  
**Root Cause:** CSS z-index stacking context not properly configured for dropdown menus  
**Resolution:**
- Added `position: relative` and proper `z-index` values to `.post-card`
- Set `.post-card .dropdown { position: static; }`
- Set `.post-card .dropdown-menu { z-index: 1050; }` to ensure dropdowns appear above all content
- Cards now properly elevate on hover with `z-index: 2`

### Issue #3: Color Scheme Not Modern
**Found By:** QA Testing  
**Description:** Initial color scheme was too generic and heavily Reddit-branded  
**Root Cause:** Default Bootstrap colors with heavy Reddit orange usage  
**Resolution:**
- Implemented modern design system with CSS variables
- Primary color: Indigo/Purple gradient (#6366f1 to #4f46e5) - professional and modern
- Accent color: Soft orange (#ff6b35) - subtle Reddit nod without copyright concerns
- Added Inter font family for clean, professional typography
- Implemented gradient backgrounds, smooth transitions, and modern shadows
- Enhanced all interactive elements with smooth animations

### Issue #4: Post Card Titles Overlapping
**Found By:** QA Testing  
**Description:** Long post titles were overlapping with other card content  
**Root Cause:** Insufficient spacing and lack of word-wrapping rules  
**Resolution:**
- Added proper padding to card bodies (1.5rem)
- Implemented `word-wrap: break-word` and `overflow-wrap: break-word` for titles
- Added proper line-height values (1.4 for titles, 1.6 for body text)
- Set `gap: 1rem` between flex columns
- Added consistent margin-bottom spacing between card elements

### Issue #5: Uncategorized Posts Page Not Working
**Found By:** QA Testing  
**Description:** Clicking on the "Uncategorized" category link showed no posts, even when uncategorized posts existed  
**Root Cause:** The `/posts` route only handled posts WITH a category_id, not posts where category_id is NULL  
**Resolution:**
- Added `uncategorized` parameter support to the `/posts` route
- Implemented filter for `category_id=None` when `uncategorized=true`
- Added "Uncategorized" link to sidebar with dynamic count
- Updated posts.html to display appropriate feedback message ("that are uncategorized")
- Posts without categories now properly display when filtering by Uncategorized

### Issue #6: Hide Categorized Toggle State Not Persisting
**Found By:** QA Testing  
**Description:** After assigning a post to a category (which triggers a page refresh), the "Hide Categorized Posts" toggle would reset to unchecked, forcing users to re-enable it every time  
**Root Cause:** Toggle state was only stored in DOM, not persisted across page reloads  
**Resolution:**
- Implemented browser localStorage to save toggle state
- Added `localStorage.setItem('hideCategorizedPosts', isHidden)` when toggle changes
- Added `localStorage.getItem('hideCategorizedPosts')` on page load to restore state
- Automatically reapplies filter if toggle was previously checked
- State persists across page refreshes, navigation, and category assignments
- Works seamlessly on both Home and All Posts pages

### Testing Metrics
- **Total Issues Found:** 6
- **Critical Issues:** 2 (Configuration, Uncategorized Filter)
- **UI/UX Issues:** 4 (Dropdown Z-index, Color Scheme, Title Overlap, Toggle State)
- **Resolution Rate:** 100%
- **All Issues Resolved:** ‚úì
